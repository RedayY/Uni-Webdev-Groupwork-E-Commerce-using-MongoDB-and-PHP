# Uni-Webdev-Groupwork-E-Commerce-using-MongoDB-and-PHP
Uni Work I had with 1 Groupmate. My Task: Complete Backend PHP, JS, MongoDB. Groupmates Task: HTML Front END.

Our Objective was to create a very basic E-Commerce website without using any SQL.

We decided to use MongoDB for our NOSQL Database Solution and to be able to run this website you must host a mongodb server on your server instance.

You could also run mongo locally and use the website to its full potential.
